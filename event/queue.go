// TODO @kris-nova
// Right now the queue is relatively "dumb" for lack of a better term.
// It might make sense to have the operator portion of the code "ACK"
// an event after it's been popped off the queue.
// For now instead of going with the "ACK" approach, we can just have
// the operator re-add it to queue and hope for it to be processed later.
// Actually that might just flood the queue. We should probably just ignore
// it. Whatever. We need to figure this out.
