Hi there %s,
</h1>

<p>
Thank you for creating a new event page (%s) for the Heptio advocacy site. Because you created a new page, we automatically generated a link for you.
</p>
</br>
<p>
Please use this link on social media, and during your presentation to share meta information about the event.


<br><br>
<i><a href="%s">%s</a></i>
<br><br>
</p>

<h2>How to use your link:</h2>

Feel free to edit your event page (the markdown file) as often as you like (you will always keep this same link, and we will stop emailing you).

This page is now the single landing page for your event! Use it on twitter, put it in your slides, whatever. 
We can now easily track clicks through your event! You will never be measured on the amount of clicks you get, we just use the data to show that advocacy works.

Common links that folks add to their event page include:

<ul>
  <li>Your Twitter.</li>
  <li>Your LinkedIn.</li>
  <li>Your GitHub.</li>
  <li>Your Personal blog.</li>
  <li>Your slides from the event.</li>
  <li>A link to the event page about your talk.</li>
  <li>Links to any resources you mention: books, repositories, videos, etc</li>
</ul>
</br>
